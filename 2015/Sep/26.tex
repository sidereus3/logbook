\section{\printdate{2015/09/26} - Setting up a Java environment}

Today I just simply set up a Java IDE for vim. Why? I tried using both
Eclipse and Netbeans, but these are not editor for me.

It's quite impossible to set up a working Java IDE on Emacs. So I
moved to vim because it works very well if coupled with \textbf{eclim}
(the \textbf{eclimd} daemon has to be manually run every time you need
it in a vim session by
\inline!$ECLIPSE_HOME/eclim!. You can the stop it inside vim with
\inline!:ShutdownEclim! or with
\inline!$ECLIPSE_HOME/eclim -command shutdown!).

The study of the Strategy Pattern has finished.
