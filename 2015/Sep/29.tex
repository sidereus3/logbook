Implementation and studying of the \textbf{Command Pattern} and of

\item macro;
\item lamba expression (function object);
\item method reference.
\end{itemize}

Reading page 237 of Head First Design Patterns, why doesn't manage the
single branch of the net (the single HRU) as a queue? You could send
to OMS branch by branch (considering the Pfafstetter numbering)
solving it in queue. In this way it's possible to implement the
managing of the net through the \textbf{Command Pattern}.

I start reading \textbf{Algorithms}.
