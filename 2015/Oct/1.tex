\section{Oct 1st 2015 - Design Patterns}

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Composite Pattern}: allows to composite objects into
  tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. Composite lets
  clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects
  uniformly.
\item \textbf{Composite Iterator}: allows to traverse the tree
  structure analizing leaf or composite and making sure all the child
  composites (and child child composites, and so on) are included.
\end{itemize}
