\section{\printdate{2015/07/04} - Research proposal}\label{sec:20150704}

Before starting to write the complete research proposal, I need a cheat sheet.

\subsection{Positive aspects in GEOtop nowadays}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Implicit numerical method;
\item Resolution of 1D and 3D problems;
\item Complex system to compute the solar height;
\item Complex system to compute the snow fallen and its compacting;
\item Resolution
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Negative aspects in GEOtop nowadays}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Structured mesh;
\item Monolithic and messy code;
\item Quite impossible adding new equation to solve the same problem in a different way;
\item Poor memory management (fluidturtle starting from 1 instead of 0);
\item So that MeteoIO could ``talk'' with GEOtop, it's necessary copying each matrix in input value by value;
\end{enumerate}
