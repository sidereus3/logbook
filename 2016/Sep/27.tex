\section{Sep 27th 2016 - Tree ds inside OMS}

After few days vacation, I came back to work. This morning I firstly
ended to set up the page style of the logbook. I upgrade the macOS
Yosemite to Sierra, fixing a problem due to a too strict management of
privileges.

On Tuesday the 20th of September I started taking class of Algorithm
and Data Structures. It is really necessary to implement clean and
fast algorithms. Today class 2pm - 4pm: exercises about
\textbf{recurrence equations}.\par\medskip

I still have to implement the Tree data structure inside OMS. The main
problem is to find the correct place to put the source code to read
the links between nodes and populate the data structure. I'm working
on the \inline!SimPanel.java! class, reading, cleaning and commenting
the code, hoping to find where the \inline!.sim! file is parsed. I
would like to add a section where reading the tree populating the data
structure. I wrote a mail to Olaf asking for a help.
